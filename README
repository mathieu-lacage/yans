1) Yans
--------

So far, this code could be labeled as a prototype since it does not implement
all the features we want. We are open to outside contributions which would be 
interested on working on some of these features or other network simulation 
models.

2) Current features
-------------------

The current implementation features:
   - a UDP/IPv4 stack without multicast
   - a nice packet API
   - a complete arp module
   - an ethernet module which uses the arp module to perform address
     translation between IPv4 addresses and MAC addresses.
   - libpcap dump support at the network interface level
   - a sample application with a simple udp source and sink pair.
   - the framework to provide a POSIX environment (this is far from the
     real thing for now).
   - a port of the BSD4.4Lite TCP stack. This stack has been ported and 
     debugged but, due to licensing incompatibility reasons, we have not
     included it in the simulator distribution.
   - a set of python bindings.

3) Build instructions
---------------------

If you want to use the python bindings, you need:
   - python (tested with 2.3 and 2.4) (see http://www.python.org)
   - Boost (tested with 1.32.0 and 1.33.1) (see http://www.boost.org)
Otherwise, you need:
   - gcc (tested with 3.4 and 4.0.2)
   - GNU make (tested with 3.80)

All of these should be available on standard linux distributions. Make
sure you install the -devel packages associated to these packages. Fedora
Core 3 and 4 have been tested and work.

What you might be tempted to change in the Makefile:
PYTHON_PREFIX_INC=/usr/include/python2.3
PYTHON_PREFIX_LIB=/usr/lib
PYTHON_BIN=/usr/bin/python2.3
BOOST_PREFIX_LIB=/usr/lib
BOOST_PREFIX_INC=/usr/include
Change them to point where your dependencies are installed. If you do
not want to build them and do not need the python modules, you can
disable the python code by editing the line:
all: dirs build build-python
and removing the "build-python" item

3.1 x86 linux build
-------------------

Nothing special: just type "make". The x86 target is built by 
default.

3.2 Darwin ppc (tiger) build
------------------------------

Tiger comes with python installed. You need to install boost
(tested with 1.33.1). gcc 4.0.2 (apple darwin tiger version)
has been used. Our tests show that it does not work with
optimization levels higher than -O0 so, don't try the others.
Python 2.3 does not seem to work very well on darwin so, we
recommend you use only python 2.4.

Make sure you set in the Makefile:
PYTHON_PREFIX_INC=/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/include/python2.4
PYTHON_BIN=/usr/bin/python2.4
PYTHON_PREFIX_LIB does not really need to be set.

build command: "make PLATFORM=ppc-darwin-gcc"
notes: 
  - make sure DYN_LIBRARY_PATH points to where libyans.dylib is
    located
  - make sure PYTHONPATH points to where _simulatormodule.so is
    located

Please, note that this build should work on both ppc64 and ppc32
machines (i.e., G4s and G5s).


4) TODO
-------

In no particular order:

- emulation support
- complete python binding
- parallelisation support
- deployment for parallelisation through python
- 802.11 model
- port to other architectures/OSes:
   - x86-64 linux
   - ppc osx
   - x86 win32
- rng
- simulator performance statistics output. i.e.:
	> The core should be instrumented to output statistics on its performance
	> (wall time elapsed, number of events processed, max event queue length,
	> etc.) Simulator should output this by default to stdout and if run in
	> quiet mode should dump to some file like testname-output/testname.log
	> or .stat
- counter/statistics facility for models -- related to logging
- timers: ability to cancel events.
  
5) Contributing/Using
---------------------

If you are interested in:
  - using this simulator
  - reporting a bug
  - contributing a new model
