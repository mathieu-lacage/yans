Packet class Functional objectives:
  1) can print a human-readable view of any of the headers of any packet
  2) can serialize and deserialize to a byte buffer any packet
  3) can prepend, append, and remove arbitrary headers and trailers to a packet
  4) can subclass the header/trailer classes.

2) should be necessary for emulation, that is, the integration
of the simulator in a real network. Otherwise, it should be 
possible to run simulations without having to provide
serializing/deserializing code which should speed quite a
bit development for a lot of protocols.
