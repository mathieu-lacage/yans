<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Yans was written as a prototype to investigate the requirements
of a complete network simulator with a large number of very different
models. The core of the simulation engine has been designed to make
the following features as easy as possible to support:
<ul>
<li>dump of trace files in libpcap format,</li>
<li>emulation: the ability to plug the simulator in a real network and
exchange packets to and from the real network,</li>
<li>integration of real-world userspace socket-based applications: 
minimal changes to the code of such applications and recompilation 
should be all that is required to run a socket-based application in the
simulator,</li>
<li>parallelisation: it should be easy to write a single simulation scenario
and run it either on a simple workstation or a large cluster of machines and
obtain a linear increase of performance with the size of the cluster,</li>
<li>scripting: it should be possible to use a scripting language
to run various simulation scenarios without requiring a recompile. tcl
should not be used.</li>
<li>Graphical User Interface: it should be possible to define and run
a simulation scenario with a user interface.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>While implementing all these features is known not to be a problem, 
so far, no single simulator has been able to offer easy-to-use
solutions to all these problems together which is why yans was started.</p>

<p>The following sections describe the C++ APIs which offer the basic
services on top of which network-specific models are implemented.</p>
