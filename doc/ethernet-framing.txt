Notes: 
1) 802.3 is never really used because it has no Control 
type reserved for ARP. (It has one for IPv4)

2) EtherType is always bigger than 0x05dc (1518) which is the
maximum length of an ethernet frame. If it is smaller, we have one of:
  - 802.3
  - LLC/SNAP
  - 802.3 "raw"

3) the LLC header when SNAP is present is: 0xaa 0xaa 0x03
Vendor Code field is set to one of:
  - the first 3 bytes of the source address
  - zero
Local Code field is set to Ether Type

4) EtherType:
  - 0x0800: IP
  - 0x0806: ARP

5) LLC Control
This field is a U field for type-1 LLC frames.
i.e., it is 1 byte big. (other types of frames/fields
have a 16 bit Control field)
Format is:
  3      1     2     2
M M M | P/F | M M | 1 1 |

M: Modifier bits, they are set depending on the mode of 
operation: Command, Response or Data

P/F: Poll / Final bit: this bit is used by the Source to solicit 
a response from the Destination. It is used by the Destination to 
respond to a solicit from the Source.

03 is, a priori, an invalid value.

Here are the possible commands:
UI- Unnumbered information (here's some data - hope it arrives)
DISC- Disconnect (we're done, shut her down)
SABME- Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode Extended (start now)
XID- Exchange IDs(Here's who I am, who are you?)
TEST- Test the link (Here's a test, send me back a test)
UA- Unnumbered Acknowledgement(Yes, I'm still here)
DM- Disconnect Mode (I'm disconnecting)
FRMR- Frame Reject (Bad frame - reject)
