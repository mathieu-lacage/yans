Things we want to modelize:
  - capture:  successful reception of the stronger frame in a collision 
    (if stronger frame arrives within the preamble of the first frame)

  - collision model:
1) both frames are lost 
2) the stronger frame is received correctly provided it is sufficiently 
   stronger and it is the first to arrive
3) the stronger frame is received correctly provided it is sufficiently
   stronger, regardless of whether it arrives before or after the weaker
   frame
4) SNIR over the signal reception is calculated.

  - clock synchronization
  - rxtx turnaround: 
  - reception decision: 
     - SNR Threshold: SNR of signal must be higher than threshold during
       all reception for correct reception.
     - PER model: length + BER(SNR) + modulation

802.11a: 
  * CCATime = 3us
  * RxTxTurnaround = 1us

backoff slot = propagation + time to detect signal + rxtxturnaround

Parallelization: on the need to maximize lookahead
  - we could use the fact that we are rx or tx to improve the reported lookahead. i.e.: we
    cannot trigger new events before the end of rx or end of tx
  - we could use routing protocol information on packet forwarding to infer
    higher bounds on the lookahead for a packet which needs to go through
    multiple hops.
