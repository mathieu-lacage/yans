Things we want to modelize:
  - capture:  successful reception of the stronger frame in a collision 
    (if stronger frame arrives within the preamble of the first frame)

  - collision model:
1) both frames are lost 
2) the stronger frame is received correctly provided it is sufficiently 
   stronger and it is the first to arrive
3) the stronger frame is received correctly provided it is sufficiently
   stronger, regardless of whether it arrives before or after the weaker
   frame
4) SNIR over the signal reception is calculated.

[2] says that 3) is the right model.

  - clock synchronization
  - rxtx turnaround: 

802.11a: 
  * CCATime = 3us
  * RxTxTurnaround = 1us
