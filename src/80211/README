This directory contains code to implement a new 802.11 PHY and MAC 
layer for ns-2.

1) The models.
--------------

1.1) PHY model.
---------------

The PHY layer implements a BER-based simulation model. A discussion
of various the various simulation models used in various simulators
can be found in "Effects of Wireless Physical Layer Modeling in Mobile 
Ad Hoc Networks" by Mineo Takai, Jay Martin and Rajive Bagrodia.
 Definitions:
   - SNIR (Signal to Noise Interference Ratio) = S / (Nf + Ni)
   - S (Signal)
   - Nf (Noise floor) = 
   - Ni (Noise Interference) = sum over all signals (minus 
     the current) of their energy
 How it receives a packet:
   - if the SNIR of the first bit of the arriving packet is higher
     than rxThreshold, lock reception onto this packet.
   - when the last bit of a locked packet is received, parse
     the event history to reconstruct the piecewise SNIR function
     during reception of this packet. 
   - Use the piecewise SNIR function to calculate the probability
     of receiving correctly each chunk of data over which the
     SNIR is constant and the transmission mode is the same.
     Specifically, this is done with 
        P_i = (1-BER_i)^nbits_i
        where :
           - nbits_i is the number of bits over which the SNIR
             and the transmission mode is constant.
           - BER_i is the BER calculated from a constant SNIR.
             Of course, it depends on the current transmission 
             mode 
   - calculate the PER = 1-product (P_i)
   - draw a random number in a uniform distribution between 0
     and 1. 
   - if the random number is higher than PER, the packet is 
     received correctly. Otherwise, it is received with errors.


1.2) MAC model.
---------------

The MAC layer was designed to implement all of the IEEE 802.11
specification. The goal is to implement:
  - IEEE 802.11 1999
  - IEEE 802.11 A 1999
  - IEEE 802.11 B 1999
  - IEEE 802.11 E/D9

2) Major Architecture decisions.
--------------------------------

* It is impossible to cancel a transmission once it has been started 
by the MAC. Specifically, you cannot go to sleep during a transmission.
This is impossible for at least the two following reasons but I am 
pretty sure that a lot of code has been written with this assumption
in mind so giving up on this requirement will be very hard if not
impossible without a full rewrite:

    - once a Tx packet has been sent on the wireless medium,
      the other stations have started received it. canceling
      the tx would mean notifying all the stations listening
      on the medium and there is no framework to do this in 
      ns-2. The receiving stations have also not been designed
      to handle interrupted RX because of interrupted TX.


* It is possible for the PHY to interrupt packet reception for
a transmission.

* Both the PHY and MAC never generate end-of-transmission events
so the state of the PHY and the MAC is not calculated when events
are received. Instead, it is lazily evaluated when a "client"
wants to know the state of the PHY or the MAC.

3) PHY architecture.
--------------------

The PHY receives three types of events:
  - start of reception (first bit of a packet is received)
  - end of reception (last bit of a packet is received)
  - start of transmission (the first bit of a packet is
    sent on the medium).

It maintains two lists of events:
  - a "reception list": it contains an entry for each packet
    which is sensed on the medium. Each entry identifies the
    packet, its size, its transmission modes, its transmission
    power, its start and end reception time. The list is sorted
    by increasing start of reception time.
    This list is used exclusively to calculate the piecewise 
    SNIR function upon the "end of reception" event. Whenever
    an element is appended to this list, we try to get rid of 
    the events which are old enough that they will never 
    interfere with any other packet received later. This is
    done with a "max packet size".

  - a "state list": each state change in the PHY is recorded 
    in this list. This list is used exclusively by the MAC to
    calculate the backoff durations. As such, this list does not
    grow when no backoff is underway and is emptied whenever
    a backoff is completed of canceled.

Its state machine is:
                 ________
                 |  TX  | +---------
                 --------          |
                   | +             |
                   | |             |
                   + |             |
 _________       ________       ________
 | SLEEP | ----+ | IDLE | ----+ | SYNC |
 |       | +---- |      | +---- |      |
 ---------       --------       --------
     +                             |
     |_____________________________|



4) MAC architecture.
--------------------

The MAC architecture is a bit complicated because we want to support
both the normal 802.11 protocol and the 802.11e extensions in the same
codebase.



The MAC is split is many pieces:
  - Mac80211 is the object which encapsulates the whole MAC stack
    for the rest of ns-2.
  - MacLow80211 is the object which implements the low-level parts
    of the ieee 802.11 MAC protocol. Specifically, it handles 
    RTS/RTS handshakes, and DATA/ACK handshakes with proper timing.

4.1) MacLow80211.
-----------------

This code deals with the following external events:
  - reception of packet from PHY: occurs when the last bit of a packet
    has been received by the PHY. The PHY reports the reception status
    of the packet.
  - reception of packet from Mac: occurs when the higher-level protocol
    layers push a packet to the MacLow for transmission on the wireless 
    medium.
This object also generates internaly quite a few events:
  - "ACK timeout": when a data transmission which requires an ACK has been
    initiated, and no ACK packet has been received during ACKTimeout 
    after the end of transmission. This event occurs at the expected end 
    of the backoff which must be started after the ACK Timeout.
  - "CTS timeout": when a RTS has been sent and no CTS has been received
    during CTSTimeout after the end of transmission of the RTS. This 
    event occurs at the expected end of the backoff which must be started 
    after the CTS Timeout.
  - "send data after CTS": a CTS has been received after a RTS. This
    event happens after SIFS after the end of reception of the CTS.
  - "send CTS after RTS": a RTS has been received. This event happens
    after SIFS after the end of reception of the RTS.
  - "send ACK after data": a DATA packet which requires an ACK has
    been received. This event happens after SIFS after the end of 
    reception of the DATA.
  - "end of access backoff": this event happens at the expected end of
    the backoff started to access the medium to start a fresh 
    transmission.
Three of these events deal with "end of backoff events":
  - "ACK timeout"
  - "CTS timeout"
  - "end of access backoff"
The really tricky bit of code which is present in this MAC is related to
the way these events are dealt with. Specifically, because the MAC
cannot continuously update its state (because of the lack of "end of 
transmission" events most notably), it needs to:
  - re-calculate its past state from the "state history" recorded
    by the PHY since the start of the backoff
  - evaluate whether or not the backoff is really completed based on 
    the "state history".
  - if the backoff is not really completed, restart the timer to
    trigger at the newly expected end of backoff.
This idea is described in a paper published at mswim'04: "scalable
simulation of large-scale wireless networks with bounded inaccuracies"
by Whengrong Ji, Junlan Zhou,Mineo Takai and Rajive Bagrodia.

The code which calculates the backoff duration is located in the Backoff
class.
