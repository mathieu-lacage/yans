This directory contains code to implement a new 802.11 PHY and MAC 
layer for ns-2.

1) The models.
--------------

1.1) PHY models
---------------

The PHY layer implements three different models:
  - a BER-based model (slow, accurate),
  - a SNRT-based model (faster, less accurate), and
  - an Energy-based model (event faster, event less accurate)

A discussion of the various simulation models used in various simulators
can be found in "Effects of Wireless Physical Layer Modeling in Mobile 
Ad Hoc Networks" by Mineo Takai, Jay Martin and Rajive Bagrodia. Reading
this paper before trying to read the rest of this documentation is
highly recommended.

 Definitions:
   - SNIR (Signal to Noise Interference Ratio) = S / (Nf + Ni)
   - S (Signal)
   - Nf (Noise floor) = 
   - Ni (Noise Interference) = sum over all signals (minus 
     the current) of their energy

1.1.1 Energy-based model
------------------------

How we receive a packet:
  - if the energy of the first bit of the arriving packet is
    higher than rxThreshold, lock reception on this packet.
  - if any packet is received during the reception of another
    packet, it is dumped immediately.

1.1.2 SNRT-based model
----------------------

How we receive a packet:
  - if the energy of the first bit of the arriving packet is
    higher than rxThreshold, lock reception on this packet.
  - if any packet is received during the reception of another
    packet, it is dumped immediately.
  - when the last bit of a packet onto which reception was locked
    is received, calculate the SNIR of this last bit.
  - if the SNIR is higher than snrThreshold, mark the packet
    as received correctly.
  - if the SNIR is lower, mark it as received incorectly.

1.1.1) BER-based model
----------------------

 How it receives a packet:
   - if the SNIR of the first bit of the arriving packet is higher
     than rxThreshold, lock reception onto this packet.
   - when the last bit of a locked packet is received, parse
     the event history to reconstruct the piecewise SNIR function
     during reception of this packet. 
   - Use the piecewise SNIR function to calculate the probability
     of receiving correctly each chunk of data over which the
     SNIR is constant and the transmission mode is the same.
     Specifically, this is done with 
        P_i = (1-BER_i)^nbits_i
        where :
           - nbits_i is the number of bits over which the SNIR
             and the transmission mode is constant.
           - BER_i is the BER calculated from a constant SNIR.
             Of course, it depends on the current transmission 
             mode 
   - calculate the PER = 1-product (P_i)
   - draw a random number in a uniform distribution between 0
     and 1. 
   - if the random number is higher than PER, the packet is 
     received correctly. Otherwise, it is received with errors.


1.2) MAC model.
---------------

The MAC layer was designed to implement all of the IEEE 802.11
specification. The goal is to implement:
  - IEEE 802.11 1999
  - IEEE 802.11 A 1999
  - IEEE 802.11 B 1999
  - IEEE 802.11 E/D9

2) Major Architecture decisions.
--------------------------------

* It is impossible to cancel a transmission once it has been started 
by the MAC. Specifically, you cannot go to sleep during a transmission.
This is impossible for at least the two following reasons but I am 
pretty sure that a lot of code has been written with this assumption
in mind so giving up on this requirement will be very hard if not
impossible without a full rewrite:

    - once a Tx packet has been sent on the wireless medium,
      the other stations have started received it. canceling
      the tx would mean notifying all the stations listening
      on the medium and there is no framework to do this in 
      ns-2. The receiving stations have also not been designed
      to handle interrupted RX because of interrupted TX.


* It is possible for the PHY to interrupt packet reception for
a transmission.

* As much as possible, we try to avoid generating end-of-transmission
events. These end-of-transmission events are lazily evaluated when a 
"client" wants to know the state of the PHY or the MAC. This idea is 
described in a paper published at mswim'04: "scalable simulation of 
large-scale wireless networks with bounded inaccuracies" by 
Whengrong Ji, Junlan Zhou,Mineo Takai and Rajive Bagrodia.

3) PHY architecture.
--------------------

3.1 Introduction
----------------

The two PHY models are implemented by the two subclasses of
the Phy80211 class which implements the core 802.11 state 
machine. The core state machine is:
                 ________
                 |  TX  | +---------
                 --------          |
                   | +             |
                   | |             |
                   + |             |
 _________       ________       ________
 | SLEEP | ----+ | IDLE | ----+ | SYNC |
 |       | +---- |      | +---- |      |
 ---------       --------       --------
     +                             |
     |_____________________________|


In all PHYs, we have tree types of events:
  - start of reception (first bit of a packet is received)
  - end of reception (last bit of a packet is received)
  - start of transmission (the first bit of a packet is
    sent on the medium).

Do we need to detail the implementation of the PHYs ?

4) MAC architecture.
--------------------

The MAC architecture is a bit complicated because we want to support
both the normal 802.11 protocol and the 802.11e extensions in the same
codebase.

-----------------------------------------------------

The MacHigh handles all of the functions related to Management
frames. Namely, in am IBSS network, we have a STA-specific MacHigh 
and an AP-specific MacHigh. The STA-specific MacHigh associates
with the AP and synchronizes with the beacons. The AP-specific
MacHigh generates the beacons and handles associated STAs (for
example, by forwarding packets from STA to STA).

A 802.11e AP MacHigh contains the 802.11e scheduler.

The MacLow handles the low-level transmission functions. 
Specifically, it generates the RTS/CTS and ACK frames, the proper
SIFS timing for bursting/fragments.

The DcaTxop handles retransmissions, fragmentation, and bursting
(i.e., OAR). It is notified by the Dcf whenever access to the
medium has been granted. The Dcf implements the Distributed
Coordination Function: it performs backoff whenever needed
and keeps accurately track of the access time.

The MacRxMiddle performs defragmentation and duplicate elimination.

A diagram which explains this is really complicated so it is included
in overall-2.dia. This is a vector graphic which you should be able
to visualize with the "dia" application. overall-2.pdf can also be 
useful.
