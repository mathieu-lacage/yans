<h2>Release 0.1</h2>
<p>
The first release: <a href="http://spoutnik.inria.fr/yans/releases/yans-0.1.tar.gz">release 0.1</a>.
This release can be considered a prototype since it does not implement all the features
we want but we are working on adding all the missing pieces. So far, this release implements:
<ul>
   <li>a UDP/IPv4 stack without multicast</li>
   <li>a nice packet API</li>
   <li>a complete arp module</li>
   <li>an empty ethernet module which uses the arp module to perform address
     translation between IPv4 addresses and MAC addresses.</li>
   <li>libpcap dump support at the network interface level</li>
   <li>a sample application with a simple udp source and sink pair.</li>
   <li>the framework to provide a POSIX environment (this is far from the
     real thing for now).</li>
</ul>
