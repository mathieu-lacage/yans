<h1>Yet Another Network Simulator</h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>This network simulator has quite a few ambitious goals:
<ul>
  <li>provide a UDP/TCP IPv4 stack with multicast support.</li>
  <li>provide a nice network interface API to plug in various types of
     network interfaces.</li>
  <li>provide at least a CSMA-CD (ethernet) network interface and a 802.11
     network interface.</li>
  <li>provide a nice Packet API which can be used to support:
    <ul>
       <li>libpcap-style packet dumps</li>
       <li>injection and sniffing of real packets in and out of the simulator
         to and from a real network</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   <li>provide an application-level API similar to normal POSIX environments
     to allow the porting of various classic socket-based applications.
     For example, apache and various routing daemons.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
So far, this code could be labeled as a prototype since it does not implement
all the features described above. We are also open to outside contributions
which would be interested on working on some of these features or other
network simulation modules.
