<h1>Yet Another Network Simulator</h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>This network simulator has quite a few ambitious goals:
<ul>
  <li>provide a UDP/TCP IPv4 stack with multicast support.</li>
  <li>provide a nice network interface API to plug in various types of
     network interfaces.</li>
  <li>provide at least a CSMA-CD (ethernet) network interface and a 802.11
     network interface.</li>
  <li>provide a nice Packet API which can be used to support:
    <ul>
       <li>libpcap-style packet dumps</li>
       <li>injection and sniffing of real packets in and out of the simulator
         to and from a real network</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   <li>provide an application-level API similar to normal POSIX environments
     to allow the porting of various classic socket-based applications.
     For example, apache and various routing daemons.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The code for this simulator is covered by the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPLv2</a> license.</p>

<h2>Get the code</h2>

<p>
The first release: <a href="http://spoutnik.inria.fr/yans/yans-0.1.tar.gz">release 0.1</a>.
This release can be considered a prototype since it does not implement all the features
we want but we are working on adding all the missing pieces. So far, this release implements:
<ul>
   <li>a UDP/IPv4 stack without multicast</li>
   <li>a nice packet API</li>
   <li>a complete arp module</li>
   <li>an empty ethernet module which uses the arp module to perform address
     translation between IPv4 addresses and MAC addresses.</li>
   <li>libpcap dump support at the network interface level</li>
   <li>a sample application with a simple udp source and sink pair.</li>
   <li>the framework to provide a POSIX environment (this is far from the
     real thing for now).</li>
</ul>
</p>
